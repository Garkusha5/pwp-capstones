# Introduction:
TomeRater is a a Python application that allows users to read and rate books.
- The purpose of this capstone is to practice implementing and testing classes in Python. 

# User:
The User class includes the attributes that can be associated with a given user. 
 
# Book:
Our User objects will be reading books. The Book class outlines attributes to associated with a given book.
- The Book class also acts as the parent class to both Fiction and Non-Fiction.

# Fiction & Non-Fiction:
Fiction and Non-Fiction are different types of Books, and inherit from the Book class.
          
# The TomeRater:
TomeRater interacts with User and Book objects, creating instances of both and allowing analysis on both! 

# Some Additional Methods:
Checks to ensure that: 
- E-mails are only associated with a single user in TomeRater
- E-mails are actually formatted like e-mails!
- ISBNs are unique to a single book
